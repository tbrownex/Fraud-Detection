For now I'm focusing on optimizing the NN. After that, look at RF and XGB.
Optimization will happen "isolated" meaning run NNoptimize on its own, not part of "buildModels".
Ensemble can happen after each has been optimized
Consider "genFeatures"
Consider "removeOutliers"
I tried using TF Datasets with Keras but found it clunky


My error is higher than the tutorial so try using their parameters and matching the error rate
