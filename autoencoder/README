Autoencoder for fraud detection with positive rate of about 1 in 570

The concept is to train an autoencoder on negatives only. Then when you run positives through it, you should see high reconstruction errors.

So the steps are:
1. Create a holdout dataset ("holdout.csv") from the entire dataset ("full") by running "createHoldout"
2. Train against "train.csv", negatives only
3. Save the trained model
4. Run all of Holdout through the trained model. There will be both positives and negatives
5. Sort the records by reconstruction error
6. Pick the top 100 or so highest errors and create Precision and Recall metrics

There are both native TF versions of the network plus a Keras version. I focused mainly on the native
